Specifically, all projects for this course will entail the following:\n",

    "- The construction, acquistion, integration, enrichment, and distribution of a project-motivated and computationally significant dataset.\n",

    "The first report on your team's project will constitue a discussion of what the dataset is that you want to build/access/create, why you believe it will be possilbe to conduct, and how long you believe it will take to build, in addition to discussion of the sorts of tasks that will be involved. Additionally, this inital project planning report should speculate and provide examples potential dataset uses, whether academic or commercial.\n",

    "With climate change shaping up to be arguably the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced in our long history, this data set hopes to start looking into where our electricty is coming from in the 21st century: __Renewables vs Fossil Fuels__. The data pulled into the __electricty_data.csv__ file looks at nearly two decades worth of information on every state in the U.S., broken down by month and the fuel source used. The goal is three-fold:\n",

    "1. To see where our power generation is coming from;\n",
    "2. To understand directionally where the U.S. is heading when it comes to sourcing our power generation;\n",

Data science is often conducted in teams, with different team members covering the diversity of knowledge and skills relevant to the different areas that a project must support to succeed. Even though our course is only focused on early-phase data science tasks (data set development), be sure to consider the strengths of your teamates and interests for gaining experience in dataset construction&mdash;if you want extensive experience with web scraping, pitch a project about this with a few other interested points. It will help to discuss interests. Be sure to write out the names of the project team's members in your first report and answer the two questions:\n",
